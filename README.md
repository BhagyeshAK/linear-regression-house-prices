## 📘 **Project: Linear Regression - House Price Prediction**

### 🔍 Overview:

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using the **scikit-learn** library. It uses a basic dataset with "Area" as the independent variable to predict "Price" (the dependent variable).

---

### 📁 Files Included:

* **`linear_regression.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code to:

  * Load and preprocess data
  * Split into train-test sets
  * Train a linear regression model
  * Evaluate using MAE, MSE, R²
  * Plot regression line
* **`house_prices.csv`**: A sample dataset with `Area` and `Price` columns.
* **`README.md`**: Documentation that explains the project objective, steps, and how to run the notebook.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

### 📈 Goal:

Predict house prices based on area using linear regression and understand key evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
