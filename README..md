# Linear Regression Project

## 📌 Objective
To implement and understand simple linear regression using the House Price Prediction Dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a simplified house pricing dataset with "Area" as the feature and "Price" as the target.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and test sets.
3. Fitted a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`.
4. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
5. Visualized the regression line.
6. Interpreted coefficients and model performance.

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **R² Score**: Variance explained by the model

## 📊 Visualization
A scatter plot was used to visualize actual vs predicted values and the regression line.

## 📚 Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## ▶️ To Run
Load `linear_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
